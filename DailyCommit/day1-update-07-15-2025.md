## topic covered:
1.Introduction to Cyber Security
1. offensice security into (redteam):
    used dirb(directory buster) tool.It is a web content scanner that helps identify hidden directories and files on a web server. It works by using a wordlist to brute-force URLs and find accessible resources that are not linked from the main page.

2. defensive security intro (blueteam):
    Security Operations Center (SOC): A centralized unit that monitors, detects, and responds to security incidents in real-time.
    Threat Intelligence: The collection and analysis of information about current and potential threats to an organization.
    Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR): The process of investigating and responding to security incidents, including data breaches and cyberattacks.
    Malware Analysis: The study of malicious software to understand its behavior, capabilities, and impact on systems.
    - virus is a piece of code that attaches itself to a legitimate program and spreads when the program is executed. It can corrupt or delete files, and it often requires user action to spread.It can make system slow and can cause data loss.
    - Trojan Horse is a program that shows one desirable function but hides a malicious function underneath. For example, a victim might download a video player from a shady website that gives the attacker complete control over their system.
    - Ransomware is a malicious program that encrypts the user’s files. Encryption makes the files unreadable without knowing the encryption password. The attacker offers the user the encryption password if the user is willing to pay a “ransom.”

3. career in cyber security
    ethical hacking (white team)
    penetration testing (red team)
    security operations center (blue team)
    Security engineering (purple team) I was suggested to learn about security engineering, which involves designing and implementing secure systems and networks. This role requires a deep understanding of security principles, risk management, and system architecture.
