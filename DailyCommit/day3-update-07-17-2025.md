## Intro to LAN
### 1. Introducing LAN Topologies:
   - **Star Topology**: All devices connect to a central hub or switch. Multiple devices can communicate simultaneously to a central point called a switch/hub. One device failure does not affect the entire network. But if the central hub fails, the whole network goes down.Good for larger networks but requires more cabling and expensive. This is the most common topology used in modern networks.
   - **Bus Topology**: All devices share a single communication line. Multiple devices can communicate simultaneously, but only one device can send data at a time.Connected with a single cable also called backbone. One wire damages the whole network. Good for small networks.
   - **Ring Topology**: Each device connects to two others, forming a ring. Data travels in one direction, and each device acts as a repeater. If one device fails, it can disrupt the entire network unless a bypass is implemented. Used in some specialized networks, but not common in modern LANs.
   - **Mesh Topology**: Devices are interconnected, allowing multiple paths for data. Each device can communicate with every other device directly. This provides redundancy and reliability, but it can be complex and expensive to set up. used in critical networks where reliability is essential.
   - **Hybrid Topology**: Combines elements of different topologies, such as star and bus. This allows for flexibility and scalability, adapting to the specific needs of the network. Common in larger networks where different departments may have different requirements.
   - **Tree Topology**: A combination of star and bus topologies, where groups of star topologies are connected to a central bus. This allows for hierarchical structuring of networks, making it easier to manage and expand. Used in larger networks with multiple departments or branches.
   - **Point-to-Point Topology**: A direct connection between two devices. This is the simplest form of networking, allowing for dedicated communication between two endpoints. It is often used in scenarios where a direct link is needed, such as between a computer and a printer.
   - **Point-to-Multipoint Topology**: One central device communicates with multiple devices. This is common in wireless networks where a single access point connects to multiple clients. It allows for efficient communication in scenarios where many devices need to connect to a single source, such as in home Wi-Fi networks.
   - **Point-to-Point Switch**: A direct connection between two devices, often used for dedicated communication. This is a simple and efficient way to connect two devices, such as a computer and a printer, ensuring that data can be transmitted without interference from other devices.

   Switch: a device that connects multiple devices in a network, allowing them to communicate with each other.[^1]
   So first internet connection is established, then the switch is connected to the router, and then the devices are connected to the switch. [reference](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtolan)[^2]

   Router: It's a router's job to connect networks and pass data between them. It does this by using routing (hence the name router!).[^3]

### 2. A Primer on Subnetting:
    - **Subnetting** is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller, manageable sub-networks (subnets). This helps improve network performance, security, and organization.
    - Subnetting is achieved by splitting up the number of hosts that can fit within the network, represented by a number called a subnet mask. subnet mask which is also represented as a number of four bytes (32 bits), ranging from 0 to 255 (0-255).
   - **Network address**: This address identifies the start of the actual network and is used to identify a network's existence. For example, a device with the IP address of 192.168.1.100 will be on the network identified by 192.168.1.0.
   - **Host address**: An IP address here is used to identify a device on the subnet For example, a device will have the network address of 192.168.1.1.
   - **Default gateway**: The default gateway address is a special address assigned to a device on the network that is capable of sending information to another network. Any data that needs to go to a device that isn't on the same network (i.e. isn't on 192.168.1.0) will be sent to this device. These devices can use any host address but usually use either the first or last host address in a network (.1 or .254). Imagine your home network is like a small village:

        üåç The Village (Your Local Network)
        Houses = Devices (your laptop, phone, smart TV).

        Each has a local IP (e.g., 192.168.1.10, 192.168.1.11).

        Streets = Connections via Wi-Fi/Ethernet.

        üö™ The Default Gateway = The Village Bridge
        What it is: The only bridge leading out of the village (your router, usually 192.168.1.1).

        Purpose:

        When you (your laptop) want to visit Google‚Äôs city (the internet), you must cross this bridge.


   - Subnetting provides a range of benefits, including:
        - Efficiency
        - Security
        - Full control
   - Let's take the typical caf√© on the street. This cafe will have two networks:

        - One for employees, cash registers, and other devices for the facility
        - One for the general public to use as a hotspot

    - Subnetting allows you to separate these two use cases from each other whilst having the benefits of a connection to larger networks such as the Internet. 

### 3. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol):
   - **ARP** is a protocol used to map an IP address to a physical MAC address in a local area network (LAN). It allows devices to discover the hardware address of another device on the same network.
   - When a device wants to communicate with another device on the same network, it sends an ARP request to find out the MAC address associated with the target IP address. The device with that IP address responds with its MAC address, allowing communication to proceed.
   - ARP is essential for enabling devices to communicate within a local network, as it ensures that data packets are sent to the correct physical address.
   - Each device within a network has a ledger to store information on, which is called a cache. In the context of ARP, this cache stores the identifiers of other devices on the network.
   - ARP sends two types of messages:
        1. **ARP Request**: When an ARP request is sent, a message is broadcasted on the network to other devices asking, "WHO HAS THIS IP ADREESS?" 
        2. **ARP Reply**: "I have this IP address, and my MAC address is this." This reply is sent directly to the requesting device.

### 4. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):
   - DHCP is a protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network. It simplifies the process of managing IP addresses and ensures that devices can connect to the network without manual configuration.
   - When a device connects to a network, it sends a DHCP request to the DHCP server, which responds with an available IP address and other necessary configuration information, such as subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers.
   - DHCP allows for efficient management of IP addresses, reducing the risk of conflicts and ensuring that devices can easily join and leave the network.
   - How DHCP woeks:
        1. **DHCP Discover**: Hey I am new here, can I get an IP address?
        2. **DHCP Offer**: DHCP says, "Sure, I can give you an IP address. Here is one I have available."
        3. **DHCP Request**: device says, "Great! I would like to use that IP address."
        4. **DHCP Acknowledgment**: DHCP says," all right, you can use that IP address for next 24 hours.
