## Network Fundamentals:

### topic covered:

#### What is networking?
1. what is a network?
    - A network is a collection of computers, servers, mainframes, network devices, and other devices connected to one another for sharing data and resources.

2. what is internet?
    - The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols to share information and resources.
    - private networks are not part of the internet, but they can connect to it.
    - public networks are part of the internet and can be accessed by anyone.

3. Identifying devices on a network:
    - Devices on a network can be identified by their IP addresses, which are unique numerical labels assigned to each device.
    - Devices can also be identified by their MAC addresses, which are unique hardware identifiers assigned to network interfaces.
    - use ipconfig command to view IP address and other network configuration details on Windows.
    -use ipconfig /all to view detailed network configuration information, including IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS servers.
    - ip address is made up of four octets, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by periods. e.g., (192.186.68.3) this is a ipv4 address.
    - IPv6 addresses are longer and consist of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons. e.g., (2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
    - Appently, they run out of IPv4 addresses, so they are now using IPv6 addresses.
    - mac address is made up of six pairs of hexadecimal digits, separated by colons or hyphens. First three pairs identify the manufacturer, and the last three pairs identify the device. e.g., (00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).

4. Ping (internet control message protocol):
    - Ping is a network utility used to test the reachability of a host on an IP network.
    - It works by sending ICMP Echo Request messages to the target host and waiting for an Echo Reply.
    - Ping can be used to check if a device is reachable, measure round-trip time, and diagnose network issues.
    - Ping command can be used in the command prompt or terminal by typing `ping <IP address or hostname>`.
