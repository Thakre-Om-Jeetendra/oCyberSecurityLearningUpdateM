# day 38- I m facing some problems leading me not able to give enough attension to this but I am keeping my streak in try hack me.


## 2. Cryptographic Failures

A cryptographic failure refers to any vulnerability arising from the misuse (or lack of use) of cryptographic algorithms for protecting sensitive information.

**Failure in protecting the confidentially of sensitive data.**

We encrypt the network traffic between the client and server, we usually refer to this as **encrypting data in transit.**

data might also be encrypted when stored on the servers. This is referred to as **encrypting data at rest.**

At more complex levels, taking advantage of some cryptographic failures often involves techniques such as **"Man in The Middle Attacks"**, whereby the attacker would force user connections through a device they control. 

Then, they would take **advantage of weak encryption** on any transmitted data to access the intercepted information (if the data is even encrypted in the first place).
